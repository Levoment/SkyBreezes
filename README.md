# How to

The first thing you want to do to get to the Sky Breezes dimension is craft a Sky Breezes dirt block. The block can be crafted with any vanilla saplings and a block of dirt.

Then all you have to do is step on the block and it will teleport you to the Sky Breezes dimension.

Alternatively you can use the command `/teleport_to_sky_breezes_dimension` and it will teleport you to the dimension. If you are already in the dimension, it will teleport you to the Overworld.
